# Front End Travel Landing Page
It's been a long time since I get my hands on front end, lately I've been surrounded with javascript and. So here's a simple landing page I created for fun (still on going). This project is build with NextJS & typescript.

- Implementing card slider for 'top destination' section
- Playing with CSS Layout - The position Property (relative, absolute) to style background 




### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework for Production
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
